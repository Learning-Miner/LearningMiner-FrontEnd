Welcome to Frontend repository for LearningMiner

This repository editor component is based on https://cansn0w.github.io/angular-concept-mapping/, we made a fork of this repo, and used it as concept map component.

Set up for development

1. Clone this repo in a convenient location using ```git clone```

2. cd to the folder /LearningMiner-Frontend.

3. Using the console, run ```npm i``` to install the whole dependencies and don't get any error.

4. Run app with ```ng serve --open```, that command will open you the browser on **localhost:4200**, but if you want another port you
could use ```ng serve --open --port port```

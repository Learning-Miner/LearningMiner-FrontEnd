    <p> The chart shows how is the distribution of topics of the student concept map. The radar shows each of the topics generated by the model, and the value the concept map gets on each. The value is the probability of the concept map to belong to a topic. </p>
    <p> Similarity: This value is the Overlapping Degree between the concept map and the base concept map. To compute this value Overlapping Degree is used, which analyses whether there is a significant number of common concepts and these are placed (connected) in the same way. This metric takes values between 0 and 1. Where 0 is completely different and 1 is exactly equal. </p>
    <p> Number of concepts: This is the number of concepts used in the concept map. A number of concepts between 15 and 20 shows long-term concept retention, good capacity of synthesis and identify important parts of text. A concept map with more than 20 concepts shows lower synthesis capacity and less than 15 concepts shows that important parts might be skipped. </p>
